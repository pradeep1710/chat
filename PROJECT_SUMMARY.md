## 🛠 Technical Implementation Highlights

### GetX State Management
```dart
// Reactive controllers with proper lifecycle management
class AuthController extends GetxController {
  final Rx<UserModel?> _currentUser = Rx<UserModel?>(null);
  final RxBool _isAuthenticated = false.obs;
  
  // Getters, API calls, and state management
}
```

### Service Layer Architecture
```dart
// Clean service separation
- ApiService: HTTP requests with Dio
- SocketService: Real-time communication
- StorageService: Local data persistence
- MediaService: File handling
- NotificationService: Push notifications
```

### Modern UI Components
```dart
// Reusable, customizable widgets
- CustomTextField: Form inputs with validation
- LoadingButton: Buttons with loading states
- Custom themes with Material Design 3
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```dart
// Centralized error handling with user feedback
try {
  final response = await _apiService.sendOtp(phoneNumber);
  // Success handling
} catch (e) {
  Get.snackbar('Error', 'User-friendly error message');
}
```
